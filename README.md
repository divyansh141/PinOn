# Pin on

I have implemented a news app named Pin on â€“ A social media platform for news seekers using flutter through which users not only can read news articles from various big news websites and publishers in different categories but also can post their own news articles to share them with their followers. It is something like a social media platform for news seekers where everybody can share their news articles and everyone can follow each other.

As mentioned above, this app allows users to post news articles so users can also include an image thumbnail to their article. To post an article, the user has to write the Title and Short Description of the respective article along with its Full Description. This app requires only storage permission from the user to use image thumbnail and to update profile picture. This app also has a feature named Pin it to save any news article that the user likes or if the user wants to read that one later.
